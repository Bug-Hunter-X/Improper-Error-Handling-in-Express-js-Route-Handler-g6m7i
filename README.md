# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers.  The example shows a route that fetches user data from a database.  If the database operation fails, the code only logs the error to the console and sends a generic 'Internal Server Error' response. This is insufficient for production applications.

The `bug.js` file contains the flawed code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Problem

The original code lacks comprehensive error handling.  Errors during database interaction aren't handled gracefully. This can result in:

* **Unexpected application behavior:** The application might crash or produce unexpected results.
* **Uninformative error messages:** Clients receive vague error messages, making debugging difficult.
* **Security risks:**  Detailed error messages may expose sensitive information to unauthorized users.

## Solution

The improved version adds comprehensive error handling:

* **Explicit error checking:** The code explicitly checks for errors returned by the database function.
* **Specific error responses:** Appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages are sent to the client based on the type of error.
* **Centralized error handling (optional):** For larger applications, consider using a centralized error-handling middleware to handle errors consistently across all routes.
